# dotfiles

> I'm still learning to configure Linux just how I like it, and I'm always breaking things and starting over from scratch. As such, I'm constantly having to rebuild everything by hand and it's getting tiresome. I figured I would delve into the world of dotfiles management.

> My dotfiles are controlled by YADM (Yet Another Dotfiles Manager) which you can find here: https://github.com/TheLocehiliosan/yadm. I'm still learning how to ues that properly as well.

> In parallel, I'm learning bash scripting and I'm working on writing a script to bootstrap the packages that I use.  That repo is here: https://github.com/omgMerrickD/i3wm-bootstrap.
